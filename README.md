# **Project Title** #
Bangla Topic Modelling Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization.


 # **Project Description**
This project aims to implement Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic modelling, a technique used to extract latent topics from a collection of textual documents. By utilizing NMF, the project will analyze a given corpus, factorize it into non-negative matrices representing document-topic and topic-word distributions, and subsequently identify and label the underlying topics. The project will enable efficient exploration and understanding of large text datasets of Bangla text , providing valuable insights into the prominent themes and trends present within the documents.

I have used C++ as the programming language.
